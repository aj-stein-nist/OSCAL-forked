## Providing feedback on this specification

The OSCAL team welcomes feedback on the work in progress in this subdirectory, whether it be questions, points for clarification, critiques or suggestions. A rendered version of the Profile Resolution specification maintained here [appears](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/processing/profile-resolution/) on the OSCAL web site.

Please post Issues in Github or questions to the OSCAL mailing list, or ask about them on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/Lobby). (See https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/contact/ for links.)

The specifications are being edited in an ad-hoc XML back end format, a lightweight extension to HTML tagging. If you wish to edit the files directly, we have stylesheets for presentation and HTML conversion along with Schematron for validation (runtime or at check points); please contact us.

### Capabilities

- XML authoring of specifications
- HTML previews with ToC / requirements index
- HTML rendering for Hugo / site load
- Back end validation support for specialized semantics
- Tagging of requirements integrates with unit tests
- Cosmetic reformatter rewrites your document with clean tagging and whitespace

- Unit test set (XSpec) is annotated with keys (links) back to spec document
- Two-way indexing enables assessment of coverage by unit tests (per marked up requirements)

- The tests themselves can be illustrated (in/out) using another rendering XSLT

### oXygen project for editing specs
